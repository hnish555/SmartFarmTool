Many farmers do not keep account of their expenses. They do not keep a note of expenditure on seed fertilizer, pesticides, labor,
machinery charges, electricity bills, etc. If maintained properly, this information can help farmers take many decisions like cutting 
out unnecessary expenses. If accompanied by various recommendations, the Smart farm tool can be a very useful tool for farmers. 
As many as 6,351 farmers/cultivators committed suicide in 2017 across India, or 17 every day, according to the latest home ministry data. 
Suicides declined 21% from 8,007, or 22 every day, in 2016, data show. These are majorly linked to money issues farmers have to face due 
to natural calamities as well as poor budget planning. We strive to provide farmers with a tool to keep an account of their expenses and 
solve the problem at hand.  The farmers can later list their produce for sale. Also, alerting farmers about news and weather changes 
through the tool.
